Networkg documentation
======================

`networkg` is a Python graph-processing library,
and this is it's documentation!

.. note::

   This is a toy-project,
   built to learn more about how Python libraries can be backed by bindings to
   a low-level language such as Rust.

   I spent a lot of time setting up CI/CD for the project,
   as well as building this documentation.
   Read more about the project in the :ref:`development`.
